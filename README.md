## About The Project

In this project, I intend to find insights about the Bitcoin market and backtest strategies to see whether they are effective.

Some main types of strategies will be tested:
- Mean Reversion
- Trend Following

New ideas might be added to the project in the future.

## About The Dataset

It is extracted from Yahoo Finance, which is originally from CoinMarketCap.
