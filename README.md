## About The Project

In this project, I intend to find insights about the Bitcoin market and backtest strategies to see whether they are effective.

Some main types of strategies are tested:
- Mean Reversion
- Trend Following

I carried out a time series analysis on BTC-USD using the Box-Jenkins Method and fit an ARIMA model to the data. I also made point forecasts and interval forecasts using the selected ARIMA model.

New ideas might be added to the project in the future.

## About The Dataset

It is extracted from Yahoo Finance, which is originally from CoinMarketCap.
